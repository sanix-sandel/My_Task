# My_Task
The script is written in Ubuntu as we know 
that the python os module in windows is different
with path access

First, the user must install the jsonschma module
in order to easily validate json according to their
schema files


By running the script (json_py.py)
on the console all the errors will be displayed also
A "errors.txt" file will be created containing all the
errors and filenames of files containing the errors so 
that it will be readble for a non-programmer.
Thank you !
